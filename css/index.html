<h2>What is Python ?</h2>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its simple, readable syntax that emphasizes code clarity and uses indentation to define blocks, making it beginner-friendly yet powerful for professionals. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages managed through **pip**, enabling development in web applications (e.g., Django, Flask), data science and machine learning (NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), automation, scripting, cybersecurity, and more. Python is dynamically typed, automatically manages memory, and runs on multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Due to its versatility, strong community support, and wide industry adoption, Python is one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages in the world.</p>
